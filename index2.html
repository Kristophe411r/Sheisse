<h2>DESCRIPTIONS & ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>

        <p> MR AKAZA PHD is best described by the people he encountered as generous, insane, classy, crazy and a lot more. Below is the list of the most memorable titles MR AKAZA PHD acquired during the years he ventured along the multiverse with his pet <em>JOJO</em>. <em> JOJO</em> is the name of the pet tick that MR AKAZA PHD initially got from his nose hairs. The small tick that he got from his nose hair is apparently the prince of tick that everyone was looking for but MR. AKAZA didn't know. He fell inlove with that small tick and made it his pet and named it <em> JOJO</em>. Everyone is still looking for the missing Prince of all tick but have no idea that the infamous <em> JOJO</em> is the lost prince and the rightful heir for the Tickingdom where the king and queen of ticks resides.</p>
